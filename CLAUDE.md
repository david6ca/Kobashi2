# Kobashi

Local bridge that proxies inference for Codex and Claude Desktop.

## NEVER kill the running Kobashi process

**Kobashi is the user's live connection to the AI they are talking to right now — including this session.** Killing it cuts the conversation mid-flight. There is no "quick restart"; the user is left with a dead client and no way to tell you so.

Do not run any of these, in any form:

- `pkill -f kobashi` / `pkill -f Kobashi.app` / `pkill -f kobashi-arm64`
- `killall Kobashi`
- `kill <pid>` against a kobashi or Kobashi.app process
- `launchctl kickstart -k` on anything kobashi-related

This holds even when it seems obviously necessary — installing a new build, freeing port 18921/18923, "just for a second". It is never worth it. **Ask the user to restart it themselves**, then wait.

The same applies to Claude Desktop (`/Applications/Claude.app`) when it is the surface the user is talking through.

### If a task seems to require a restart

Do the part that doesn't, then stop and hand off:

> The new build is at `dist/Kobashi.rar`. To install it: quit Kobashi from its menu, extract the RAR outside the synced checkout, replace `/Applications/Kobashi.app`, and relaunch.

Editing files, building, and verifying logic against a copy are all fine — none of that needs the process down.

## Ports

- `18921` — Codex bridge (`~/.codex/config.toml` → `model_providers.kobashi`)
- `18923` — Claude gateway (`~/.claude/settings.json`, Claude Desktop managed-config)

Both are written by kobashi at startup and restored on exit. A port showing as busy is normal operation, not a stale process to clean up.

## Config injection

`writeCodexConfig()` / `writeClaudeConfig()` inject; `restoreCodexConfig()` / `restoreClaudeConfig()` undo.

`stripInjectedCodexConfig()` exists because the old restore path deleted the user's entire `config.toml` when no `.bak` was present, taking their notify/marketplaces/plugins/mcp_servers config with it. Keep restore surgical — remove only the injected `model_provider` line and `[model_providers.*]` section, never the file.

## Session state

`~/.kobashi/session.json` (holds `github_token` — chmod 600).

Migrated from the legacy `~/.codex/ccb-session.json`, which was wrong twice over: kobashi's own state living in Codex's config dir, under a `ccb-` prefix left from when this was called "Copilot Bridge". `migrateLegacySession()` handles the move; don't reintroduce writes under `~/.codex/`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build:mac     # pkg + swiftc + rar → dist/Kobashi.rar
npm run build:win     # Git Bash on Windows → dist/Kobashi.exe
```

Version comes from `package.json` only. Both scripts delegate to `scripts/build-local.js`, which stages the build sources and dependencies in a unique local temporary directory outside OneDrive. Version/date stamping via `/* BUILD_STAMP */` touches only that copy. The source checkout is never stamped. The temporary workspace is removed on success or failure.

Only the finished `Kobashi.rar` / `Kobashi.exe` and `SHA256SUMS.txt` go back into `dist`. Keep all compiler output, `.app` bundles, temporary files, and intermediate binaries outside the synced checkout. `KOBASHI_BUILD_TMPDIR` can select another local scratch directory; it must not be inside OneDrive or the checkout. Do not bypass the staging wrapper. macOS packaging needs `rar` on PATH or an absolute `KOBASHI_RAR_BIN` path.

Extract installation archives outside the repository: `open -a Kobashi` matches by bundle id and can launch an unpacked build copy instead of the installed app.
